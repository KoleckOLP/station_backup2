# station_backup2
Code to backup computers over the network.

<h3>This code has czech names comments and such because it was made for my work.</h3>

This code is a rewrite of a batch script my colegue wrote for work,<br>
I didn't really like the original code because it had a default name and password and path to backup.<br>
If you needed to backup something that was not standard, it had to be hardcoded.

Mine version is made to be as modular as it can.

This program is Windows x64 only and should be portable, that's why ruby, 7zip and blat are incuded in "programy" folder.
