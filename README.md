# station_backup2
Code to backup computers over the network.

This code is a rewrite of a batch script my colegue wrote for work,<br>
I didn't really like the original code because it had a default name and password and path to backup.<br>
If you needed to backup something that was not standard, it had to be hardcoded.

Mine version is made to be as modular as it can.
